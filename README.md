# RandomPoemApp

This is Java app which parses the grammatical rules from a text file, then uses the parsed data to generate a random poem. Here is an example of what the output might look like:

	my sun among her white meadow
	moon upon my light
	moon
	your rain climbs
	her murky bright clear willow
